We will put our Discrete Math notes here.

### Tools: 
_(You can add the tool that you find useful for this project.)_
  - **MacTex or MicTex :** This is basic latex packages for windows(MikTex) and mac(MacTex). I am not sure if they works on Linux.
  - **http://www.onlineocr.net :** The text converter from an image or PDF. Since our book is in image format. This tool is really time saver.
